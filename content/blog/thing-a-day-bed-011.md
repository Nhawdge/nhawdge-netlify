Inspiration: Bed

So I drew a bed. I saw it on the way to the bathroom. I have no idea how to draw a perspective view of things. I tried on Saturday, but it went so badly I didn't even post it. It was very incomplete, and I had spent over an hour working on it. It was mostly erasing. Still it was much needed practice. Today I'm tired. so I drew a mediocre (that's very forgiving) bed.
