Alright here's another one. I am so thankful that I'm the only one who reads my blog, or I'd be ashamed of putting this one online. It's pretty bad, and the reason it's bad is because I tried. I genuinely tried. I took longer than my intended 15 minutes. The word was Astute, which reminded me of the Minotaur in the Labyrinths, Asterius. So I tried to draw a minotaur with a log? I guess? I don't know. I'm posting this for me, not you.
