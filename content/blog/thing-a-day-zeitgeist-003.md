Alright, so I already am feeling more confident with my tablet, and with Krita. Setting a 15 minute timer for these really helps me not spend too much time on detailing. I'm trying to expand on different brushes, and also using colors out of my wheelhouse. Normally my art is always grayscale, which is downvote worthy.
