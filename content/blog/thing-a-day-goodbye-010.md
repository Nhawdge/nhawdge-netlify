Today's Inspiration: Goodbye

Well, I made it to ten things. I'm pretty proud of my self. I am known for my side project abandonment, and I can't believe I've made ten arts. I really enjoyed this one, and I really liked the techniques I tried (and mostly learned from). 

I was planning something a lot more in my head, but I realized I couldn't get any more from my mind's eye. I saw a beautiful scene between some sort of adventurer and his trusty steed, split by a sudden chasm in the land. It got weird. The beauty of making art, is that no one ever knows when it's finally done. I could have spent a ton more time on this, but I like that I can simply be happy with it, and move on to the next one. I can't help but think of this story about a pottery class

> A ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality. His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the "quantity" group: fifty pound of pots rated an "A", forty pounds a "B", and so on. Those being graded on "quality", however, needed to produce only one pot — albeit a perfect one — to get an "A". Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the "quantity" group was busily churning out piles of work – and learning from their mistakes — the "quality" group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.

Let's make some more mistakes. See ya tomorrow.
