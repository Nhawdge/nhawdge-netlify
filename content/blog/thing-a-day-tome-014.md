Inspiration: [Tome](https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day/tome-2022-01-11)

This is a word of the day from a prior day. Who cares. THERE ARE NO RULES. Only a vague incentive to practice. I'm not sure if anyone noticed, but I did install the tablet drivers finally. This added the much needed pressure sensitivity I was lacking. It's so much crazier to use now. I really really like it. Anyway, after my failed attempt at making a color pallet, I've decide to just do a few colors that fit, and not pick them ahead of time. Maybe I'll try again later? WHO KNOWS. NO RULES.

To dispel any rumors. I'll never write a book. So the picture is a reference to that. It's not a book of things I won't do, it's more literal than that. Okay bye.
