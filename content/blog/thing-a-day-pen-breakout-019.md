(Big) Thing a day this time. I'm super proud of this one. I finally finished a game. Or at least I think I finished it. There's so much polish to be done. HOWEVER, this was for a 3 day [game jam](https://itch.io/jam/mini-jame-gam-7). I drew all the art with Krita, wrote all the code in c# (.net6) and only tool I leveraged was Raylib to handle the drawing. 

Since this is usually art focused, here's a couple images I made for this project.
