Today's Inspiration: [Rejuvenate](https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day/rejuvenate-2022-01-01)

Well it's January first of 2022. A new year, a new you. Something something who cares. Today I really tried to abide the 15 minute timer, mostly because I was sick of drawing plants that didn't look quite right. I spent way too much time trying to find the right brush. But honestly, good for me. I am learning, I'm really enjoying layering my work, it makes me feel so much more confident with overlapping colors. The "color rate" and opacity brush features really add a new level of depth in art I wasn't familiar with. TL;DR I'm kinda proud of how the water and rocks turned out. it was pretty fun to make.
