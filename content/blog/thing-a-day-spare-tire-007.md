Today's Inspiration: Spare Tire

Well it's a bit late, but I stuck to the 15 minute timer (it helps when I've got no interruptions). I really gotta say I love that timer. I really can't waste too much time for long on a single piece. I tried some more water color brushes today, and expanding out of my comfort zone again. I know it's only been a week, but dang does it feel like I'm making great progress. I wonder what it will look like next year.

## Should be captioned - "At least we've still got the spare..."
