Jaun had never been imprisoned before. He also hadn't dove to his death
in a cave of mudmen who had imprisoned good people before either. It was
quite the day of firsts. The mugert was dragging Jaun down a length
hallway. The floor seemed much smoother than the last room he was in. He
had a hunch he was getting closer to the main area, whatever might be
there.&nbsp;

"So where are you taking me?" Jaun asked the mudman, hoping for an
answer. The mugert simple grunted without any indication it was even for
him. He thought about yelling for help, but if Khir were going to help,
they would have helped each other a long time ago. Jaun wiped his brow
on his shoulder. He wasn't sure what was going to happen next.&nbsp;

After a short while the mugert put Jaun into a cell in a small room with
other cells lining the walls. His legs were still shackled, but he at
least had his arms free. He never saw the mugert carrying his sword, and
he feared the worst. It was probably tossed in the chasm, and now half
way to the Golden Sea. Jaun started looking around. He could hear faint
moaning from one of the other cells, but it didn't sound friendly. He
sat on the bench for a moment to dwell.

"How many times am I going to face my death?" he said, pushing his palms
into his forehead. "This isn't fair! I just want to be an adult. I want
to help my neighbor, and defend my friends." Jaun kicked at the wall,
completely forgetting about the shackles and knocked himself down. "UHG"
he cried, as he landed on his back. "What did I just land on?" he
thought. 

"The pickaxe heads!" Jaun shouted in excitement. He quickly covered his
mouth and looked out the door to see if anyone had heard. He was pretty
sure he was safe. "Okay, what can I do with these?" The outer walls were
pretty rough and seemed like they had been mined out years ago. 
But the wall between his cell and the next one seemed rather fresh and
new. Jaun took one pickaxe head, and put it into the wall, and smashed
the back with a second pickaxe head, like a hammer. 
The wall began to give almost immediately. He quickly stopped.
