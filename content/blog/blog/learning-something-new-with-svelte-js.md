As with most weekends. I try to do a little bit of coding. At [work](https://blendinteractive.com/) recently we were chatting about JAM stack frameworks, and we briefly talked about Svelte. After making this blog with Gatsby I wanted to give it a shot.

Without further ado, [here it is](https://jackbox-picker.netlify.app/). Every Saturday night, a group of friends of varying size gets together and we play [Jackbox games](https://www.jackboxgames.com/). Our current system of picking a game is usually someone wants to play a game, but they can't remember the name, or which party pack it's in. I started this to help everyone find their game, or find a new one we might not have tried before. 

If you're interested in the code, you can find that [on github](https://github.com/Nhawdge/jackbox-picker)
