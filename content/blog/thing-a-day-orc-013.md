Inspiration: Orc
 
Okay, Cool. I sketched an orc. I spent a little more time, and I tried very very hard to stop using Ctrl Z to undo stuff. The more I practice the more I realize that no single stroke is perfect. It's the combination of all the strokes that make the picture. Which is kind of cool when you think about it. I'm just here for the extra practice. I also skipped the eraser for just coloring in white. Hopefully I will re attempt this picture for day 113 and see how it looks. I definitely feel some progress from my practice.
