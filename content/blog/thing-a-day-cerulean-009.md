Today's Inspiration: [Cerulean](https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day/cerulean-2022-01-06)

I had a lot of fun going off nothing but a color today. I was doing good and I kinda messed up the ice, but I guess I've just never seen a real ice berg? It's okay, I'm having fun, what else matters? I'm not monetizing my hobby. I am starting to like the idea of adding a caption or a title, so I'll do that now too. Getting pretty good at spelling cerulean too. Anyway, I hope I enjoy this in a year when I try to recreate it with proper skills?

Confession time. I didn't draw yesterday's tree yesterday. It was a learning idea and I posted it because I fell asleep too early. OH WELL.
