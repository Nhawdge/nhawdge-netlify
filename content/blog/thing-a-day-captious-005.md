Today's Inspiration: [Captious](https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day/captious-2022-01-02)

Alright, I'm going to start off by apologizing. This is atrocious, and I should know better not to post this kind of garbage on the internet. I set a timer for 15 minutes, and I took 45 minutes. LOTS of playing with colors. LOTS of brush guess work. PEOPLE ARE HARD TO DRAW. But if I don't practice, I can never get better. I will say this one started so much worse than he looks. 

Again, I'm sorry.
