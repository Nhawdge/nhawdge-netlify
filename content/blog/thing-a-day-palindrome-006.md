Today's Inspiration: [Palindrome](https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day/palindrome-2022-01-03)

I'm kind of proud of todays, I was really not sure what I was going to draw with palindrome, as I've been avoiding heavy word usage. When I was suddenly inspired by my good friend [A](http://aaronlael.pythonanywhere.com/) [A](https://github.com/aaronlael) [R](https://github.com/aaronlael/rpsls) [O](https://stackoverflow.com/users/8997676/aaron-lael) [N](https://talkkafkatome.herokuapp.com/). He not only suggested that I draw a palindrome itself, but that I draw the famed Tacocat. SO I DID. Anyway, it was fun, I enjoyed it. Happy whatever-this-is-ing
