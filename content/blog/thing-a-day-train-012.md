Inspiration: Train

I drew a train. I was reading my daughter some Daniel Tiger books before bed and in one of the classroom pictures there was a delightful crayon drawing of a train. And I said to myself, "Hey, (what's going on) I know I'm not as good as a professional artist pretending to be a kid, but lets try anyway." So I tried to mimic the train. I think my biggest problem was that I used a chalk brush instead of a crayon brush. OH WELL it was fun way to rekindle more drawings.

<sub>For those of you watching timestamps. Yes I missed a few days. No, I don't care. I was working on a super secret bigger thing of the day. I hope to finish before the end of next month. </sub>
