Inspiration: [Ow my Wrist](https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day/juggernaut-2022-01-23)

I challenged myself to an under 5 minute sketch. I was feeling pretty confident with the body, but I'm still struggling with arms. It was fun to rush and see what I could skip while still getting the image out of my mind. This art thing is hard.
